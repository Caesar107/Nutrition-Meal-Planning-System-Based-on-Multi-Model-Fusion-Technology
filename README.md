As the demand for healthy eating continues to grow, nutritional meal planning has become an essential means to achieve a healthy diet. However, providing nutritionally balanced and personalized meal plans for individuals with different health conditions and dietary preferences poses significant challenges. To address this issue, this paper develops a nutritional meal planning system based on multi-model fusion technology. The system integrates user feature learning models, food feature learning models, and Deep Structured Semantic Models (DSSM), along with various data processing techniques. By thoroughly analyzing the nutritional information in food databases and user health data, the system achieves personalized and nutritionally balanced meal recommendations.
The system is implemented using the Python programming language, with data cleaning and preprocessing performed using the Pandas and NumPy libraries. The DSSM model is employed to achieve semantic matching of user and food features. The system architecture adopts a front-end and back-end separation design, with the front-end implemented in JavaScript for user interaction and the back-end using the Flask framework to build API services. SQLite is used for data storage and management. Experimental results demonstrate that the system excels in recommendation accuracy, response speed, and user satisfaction, indicating broad application prospects and practical value.
